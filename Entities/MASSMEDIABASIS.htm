					Policy making is influenced by a number of factors, including electoral politics, ideological biases
					of actors involved in the policy making process, and the interlocks between corporate and government
					entities. This influence is also exercised by shaping public opinion through mass media. We study
					this influence through the two effects of mass media, namely agenda-setting and framing. The ability
					of mass media to influence the importance placed on various public topics is called agenda-setting.
					The phenomenon of media focusing attention on certain events and then placing them within a field of
					meaning or perception is called framing.<br><br>
					In this respect, we study four of the most prominent economic policies covered by mass media, namely
					Demonetization, Aadhaar, GST, and Farmers’ Protest. We select these economic policies for our
					analysis
					as they are among some of the main policy events that have happened over the last few years.</a>
					<br><br>
					To study agenda-setting, we look at the coverage of different aspects in each of these policies in
					mass media and in the social media community of followers of mass media houses. To study framing, we
					define five constituencies which are the dominant frames of perception corresponding to these
					events. These constituencies are poor, who typically benefit from wealth distribution strategies;
					middle class, consumers who have disposable income, and benefit through tax breaks and lower prices;
					corporate, which include big corporates, formalization, economic growth, free-market policies, and
					minimum governance; informal sector, driven by small enterprises and aided by slow formalization of
					industries and trade, also including agriculture; and government in terms of pro/anti viewpoints
					towards the state. For each policy event, we map each aspect to these five constituencies based on
					whether the aspect supports or opposes or is not applicable to the particular constituency. For
					example, for Demonetization, the aspect on <i>[Queues at banks and ATMs]</i> is classified as pro-middle
					class because most articles on this aspect were negatively writing about the problems caused to the
					common people in getting cash at ATMs. The same aspect is classified as anti-government because
					negative articles on this aspect were critical of the government’s apathy and lack of
					foresightedness in handling the issue.

			<h2 style="text-align: center;color: #05386b !important;">Alignment of Newspaper's towards different
				constituencies</h2>

				<p
					style="margin-inline-end: 2%;margin-inline-start: 8%;padding: 2.5px 2.5px 2.5px 2.5px; font-size: 14px !important;">
				As stated earlier, we map each aspect corresponding to a policy to five constituencies or frames of presentation. Each aspect is thus provided an alignment score of -1/0/+1 corresponding to each constituency based on if the majority articles in the aspect speak positively or negatively about the constituency. Using the (aspect,constituency) alignment matrices for the four events, we obtain a constituency vector (of five dimensions) for each news-source. Briefly speaking, each of these scores in the vector is the aggregated sentiment of the news-source towards the constituency, weighted by the aggregate coverage of the constituency. We then perform a principal component analysis or PCA of the (newspaper,constituency) matrix to obtain the plot shown here. The first component (x-axis) here denotes a pro-poor alignment towards the right, and a pro-corporate and pro-informal sector alignment towards the left. The second component (y-axis) shows and pro-government and pro-middle class alignment towards the top.
				
				Using the plot on the right, we try to answer the question: "Do news-sources have a bias
					towards or against constituencies like the poor, middle class, corporate, informal sector,
					and government?".<br><br>

					We find that Hindu, Deccan Herald, and IE are centrist news-sources, with a slight alignment
					towards the poor. In other words, these papers cover issues of the poor more than the
					others. Hindustan Times is seen to be biased towards political issues or issues related to
					the government. Times of India is seen to cover issues of the middle class. Finally,
					Telegraph is seen to be biased towards giving more coverage to the informal sector and small
					trades.<br><br>

					It is important to note that here we consider an article’s alignment to a constituency based
					on the face-value of what the newspaper states about the constituency. For example, if the
					newspaper states that a particular policy is helpful for the poor, we assume the article to
					be aligned to the poor constituency. We do not impose any ideological evaluation on the
					views expressed in the media, of whether the statements are true or not from different
					perspectives.

									unique identification number. The data is collected by the Unique Identification
									Authority of India (UIDAI), a statutory authority under the jurisdiction of the
									Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology. The issue has been criticized
									owing to lack of security and privacy in citizens’ data collection and storage
									mechanisms, and also because of an allegedly faulty implementation of the platform

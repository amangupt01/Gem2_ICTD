					Models for socio-economic development are useful for planners to build appropriate policies. Such
					models are ideally constructed based on empirical data, and we take up the problem of working
					towards a district development model for India by using two waves of census data. India has almost
					six hundred districts, diversely spread apart in terms of both social and economic development, and
					hence presents a unique natural experiment to understand how social and economic factors interplay
					with one another. We present some interesting observations we are able to make from longitudinal
					analysis of census data from the years 2001 and 2011.
					<br><br>
					Census variables have multiple parameters which report the number of households in a district for
					each parameter. We group these mutually exclusive parameters into three broad parameter types of
					rudimentary, intermediate, and advanced. As an example, firewood is considered as a rudimentary type
					of fuel for cooking, kerosene and cow dung are grouped together as an intermediate type, and PNG,
					LPG and biogas are grouped together as advanced types of fuel for cooking. We then do a k-means
					clustering on the districts based on the percentage of households in each district that use
					different types of fuel: rudimentary, intermediate, and advanced. This allows us to label each
					district as a level-1/2/3 district: Level-1 districts predominantly use rudimentary types of fuel
					for cooking, level-2 districts primarily use intermediate types of fuel, and level-3 districts
					predominantly use advanced types of fuel for cooking. We follow the same method for all indicators
					viz. Main Source of Light, Main Source of Water, Asset Ownership, Fuel for Cooking, Bathroom
					Facility and Condition of Household.
					<br><br>
					Assigning levels to districts based on socio-economic parameters makes it easy to interpret and
					further helps to easily compare districts with one another using simple probabilistic analysis to
					determine broad patterns which we divide into 6 hypotheses. They not only highlight the key trends
					in socio-economic development across the past few years, but also illustrate a good method for
					simplifying complex multi-dimensional data into simple units for making comparison.

				We also use images from Landsat 7 satellite to train a district-level machine learning model to predict
				the level of development. Once trained, this model was used to predict development labels for years from
				2001 to 2011 and 2009 to 2019. A neural network based change classifier was made which would take labels
				from 2001 to 2011 and predict the difference between ground truth in 2011 and 2001. Post this, for each
				district, we calculate a count of number of indicators (out of 6) that have improved between 2001 and
				2011. This change classifier was used to predict development from 2009 to 2019.

				<br><br>
				The map on the left shows the results of our change classifier between 2001 and 2011, and the map on the
				right shows the change between 2009 and 2019. The map is color-coded on the basis of degree of change,
				from red (symbolizing negative or no change) to green (symbolizing positive change). During 2001 to
				2011, we can see that states from the eastern part of India (such as Orissa, Bihar, Jharkhand, and West
				Bengal), large parts in central India (Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh), and the Northeast districts,
				showed very little change. These indeed have been the poorest states of the country. In contrast, states
				such as Gujarat, Maharashtra, and Rajasthan saw many districts as having improved substantially. We are
				currently correlating these observations with potential explanatory factors such as the degree of
				industrialization in these districts which could have led to more rapid growth as compared to other
				non-industrialized and predominantly agricultural districts.During 2009-2019, there has been more
				widespread growth in the poorest states, especially in West Bengal, Orissa, Uttar Pradesh, and Madhya
				Pradesh. States like Jharkhand and Bihar have however not progressed substantially. This seems to tally
				with our general observations of more development attention having been paid to some of the parts which
				have developed during this time.

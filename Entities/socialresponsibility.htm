                    In 2013, the government introduced a regulation mandating companies with profits of over Rs 5 Crore
                    to donate 2% of their profits towards Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) in areas like
                    healthcare,
                    education, rural development, environment, national relief, gender equality, heritage & culture,
                    cleanliness, slum area development, sports and armed forces welfare etc.
                    We were curious to know if CSR investments made in particular geographies could have been used
                    as a means by corporate entities to build favourable networks with politicians affiliated with these
                    geographies.

                    The following table shows a linear regression analysis carried out on the CSR data in India, 
			for investments during the financial year of 2014-15. In the table, the leftmost column shows the factors that might influence CSR spending, 
			and on the right, we have six regression models. While the predictive power of the models is low, 
			many of the factors have a statistically significant relationship with determining CSR funding. </p>

                    <br>(a) In the first regression model, the two significant variables (or factors) observed were
                    “whether the constituency in which a CSR investment was made is GEN and not backward” and “whether
                    the constituency is SC and not backward”, with p-value less than 0.001, for a positive relationship
                    with the dependent variable. In other words, CSR spending is more in constituencies that are of
                    general category and non-backward, or are of SC category and non-backwards.It cannot be stated with
                    statistical significance whether backward constituencies are able to draw CSR investments, other
                    than ST constituencies that show a positive relationship with p-value less than 0.01.

                    <br><br>(b) In the second model, the “Vote Margin percentage between the current MP elected from a
                    constituency and the runners up candidate from the constituency in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections” was
                    added as an independent variable. This variable is also found to have a significant positive
                    coefficient and small p-value. This shows that if the vote difference percentage is higher, the CSR
                    amount spent in the corresponding constituency is more than the amount spent in other
                    constituencies.

                    <br><br>(c) In the third model, the aim was to find out if the alignment of the current MP from the
                    constituency with the ruling party of the union or state government has any relation with the CSR
                    amount spent in the MP’s constituency. Result of this analysis shows that the state alignment
                    variable is significant with a positive relationship. In other words, the CSR amount spent in the
                    constituencies of MPs belonging to the ruling party of the state is more, compared to other
                    constituencies. No relationship was found between the alignment of MPs with the ruling party at the
                    centre.

                    <br><br>(d) In the fourth model, we wanted to see if the MP from a constituency being a Minister in
                    the Union Government may have an influence on the CSR expenditure. Therefore, an independent
                    variable, “whether the MP is a central minister” was added. We find that this variable is not
                    significantly related with CSR spending.<br><br>

                    It is however observed that a number of ministers are from the Rajya Sabha. We also verify if the
                    CSR amount spent in a district has any relation with the district selected by the Rajya Sabha MP
                    (also a union minister) for spending his/her MPLAD fund. Results show that it has a strong positive
                    relation with a p-value 0.005. This means that if any district in a constituency is selected by the
                    Rajya Sabha MP for using the MPLAD fund, the CSR spending in that district is higher compared to the
                    others.


                    <br><br>(e) In the fifth model, the vote margin percentage was added to the four independent
                    variables used in the fourth model. It was found that vote margin remains a significant feature and
                    there is a slight increase in R squared value of the model. In other words, the vote-margin, state
                    alignment, and MPLAD funding are all robust relationships in their own right.


                    <br><br>(f) In the sixth model, we tried to observe if the variable, “whether there is any overlap
                    between the industry sector of the company involved in CSR and the sectors of influence of the MP’s
                    ministry (if MP from that constituency is a minister)” has any impact on the CSR spending. This
                    could indicate for example, that by contributing CSR funding to the constituency of a minister, the
                    company could be buying favours from the ministry with which the minister is associated and which is
                    of particular interest to the company as well. This variable was found to be very significant with a
                    positive coefficient, which implies that if the MP is a minister and the policies framed by his/her
                    ministry influences the sector that the company works in, then the CSR amount spent in the
                    constituency is higher.

                    We show the state-wise expenditure by companies on CSR activities using the above

                    (a) The figure shows the total state wise CSR expenditure. <br>
                    (b) The figure shows the per capita CSR expenditure (total expense divided by the population

                    In 2014-15, Maharashtra and Tamilnadu were the two most preferred states for CSR expenditure.
                    Whereas, Lakshadweep, Andaman and Nicobar, Mizoram, Nagaland, and Tripura were the states where
                    companies
                    were least interested to spend their CSR fund in. Also, Approx 5% of the total
                    was spent in 4 most backward states of India ( Jharkhand, Odisha, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh).
                    Similar trends are observed even when considering per capita investments.</p>

                    During 2014-15 which was the first financial year when CSR was made mandatory, sectors covering
                    Education,
                    Differently Abled people, and Livelihood were the most preferred sectors (Rs 3188.09 Cr i.e. approx.

                    followed by Health, Eradicating Hunger, Poverty And Malnutrition, Safe Drinking Water, and

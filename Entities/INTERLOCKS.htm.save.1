					Corporate executives
					who enter politics or government administration, or family members of public officials with
					links
					to corporate organizations, are known to build an interlocking social network that becomes a
					power structure of
					highly
					influential entities. This power structure often leads to a bidirectional flow of favors between
					the corporations
					and
					political entities, and it can influence policy formulation or manifest itself in crony
					capitalism (or
					corruption).
					Such negative manifestations of corporate-government interlocks have been evident in India.

In this figure, we show the importance and impact of people relations in the corporate network. The figure on the left hand side shows the company-subsidiary network, which only consists of owner companies, and the companies held by them (subsidiaries). An owner and a subsidiary are connected by an edge. The figure on the right hand side shows the same network, but this time with also people connections. In this network, we have connections between owners and subsidiaries as before. But alongside, we also have connections between companies if they share some common board members between them. We call these connections "people connections".
<br><br>
We can see here that the company-subsidiary network is very sparse, showing few connections and a low density. But as soon as we add the people connections in this network, it becomes much denser. We have also shown the politically connected companies (in both figures) as the bigger, blue nodes. These findings indicate towards two points: 
<br><br>
1. Most of the interlocks between companies occur through people connections, or by way of common board memberships. <br>
2. Many of the politically connected companies are mostly located towards the dense core of the network, i.e., many of the politically connected companies are also highly connected with other companies and may hold &nbsp; considerable network power. <br><br>

								whose constituency the company C1 donated amounts under CSR in the same sector in which
								the minister is placed (i.e., the sector for CSR donation is included in the ministry
								controlled by the minister). The relations of the form C1---D---C2 represent common
								board memberships (i.e., D is a director on board of both of the companies C1 and C2).

								We have created an indicator of corporate government overlap, which reflects how much
								the corporate and government networks overlap. This indicator empirically measures the
								number and strength of edges between the two networks and calculates a single score that
								represents the strength of overlap between them. In the above figure, we plot this score
								over the period of four Lok Sabha elections.<br><br>
								We consider companies and their managers to be the part of the corporate network, and
								the politicians and bureaucrats (IAS officers) to be a part of the government network.
								An overlap between these two networks occurs in the form of bridge edges, i.e., edges
								that connect the two networks. Some examples of bridge edges include: a politician who
								is connected to a company as a manager, a politician whose relative is the manager of a
								company, etc. Our index measures the number and strength of such bridge edges. <br><br>
								As we can see, the indicator of overlap increases over time. This means that the
								corporate and government worlds are increasingly getting interconnected, and over the
								years, this interconnection is increasing. Quite often, the flow of benefits between the
								corporate and government worlds manifests itself through these bridges.<br><br>
								Data sources: The data to build the network was obtained from different web sources. The
								corporate data was obtained from the websites of ministry of corporate affairs (MCA),
								and Bombay Stock Exchange (for public listed companies). The politician data was
								obtained from India votes (Lok Sabha), and Wikipedia (Rajya Sabha and Prime/Chief
								Ministers data). The bureaucrat data was obtained from Persmin (shared with us by Ashoka
								university). The corporate network includes the BSE public listed companies, their
								directors and managers, and a 1-hop neighbourhood of other companies and people to whom
								this network is linked. The government network includes politicians who contested the
								Lok Sabha elections for the years 2004, 2009, and 2014, IAS bureaucrats during the
								period 1961 to 2017. The corporate network includes companies and their managers formed
								since 1980 till date.

Aspects are subtopics of discussion within a given policy. 
Some aspects of GST <i>[Training Programmes for Creating GST Awareness, 
Effect of GST on GDP and Economy, GST Bill Discussion in Parliament.]</i> 
We calculate aspect coverage as the relative number of words written about an aspect by a newspaper 
(in other words, it measures the space provided to an aspect by a newspaper). 
Aspect coverage for social media is similarly the relative number of tweets provided 
to an aspect by the followers of a newspaper 
(in other words, it measures the attention given to an aspect by the readers of the newspaper). 
The graph on the left shows the aspect coverage distribution for the newspaper, 
and the graph on the right shows the aspect coverage distribution for social media.

<b>Aspect Coverage of GST in Mass Media</b><br>
In GST the top aspect covered in mass media includes discussions on the <i>[troubles faced by small traders to meet the GST registration deadline].</i> 
This aspect directly relates to the trouble that the small traders and businesses faced across the country, 
in registering for GST due to impending registration deadlines and faults in the GST registration software, 
and does not include discussions around the issues of the consumers.<br>
Examples of issues related to consumers include rise in the price of commodities and 
services because of more of them coming under the tax umbrella due 
to a push towards formalization, leading to informal enterprises dying out and making way for formal enterprises.<br>
The second highest covered aspect in mass media discusses the <i>[implementation of the GST bill in different states]</i>, 
with a significant amount of discussion revolving around the applicability of GST in Jammu and Kashmir, 
a state granted special status. 
This aspect does not relate to the issues of the middle class and the poor directly.
<br>
For GST, the primary focus of the media is thus on the troubles faced by traders in registering for GST. The issues relevant to the consumers see a clear deficiency in attention.<br><br>

<b>Aspect Coverage of GST in Social Media by news sources</b>
<br>
We find that the social media community of followers of these news-sources echo the same trend. The top five aspects covered by the social media follower community are mostly the same as the top five aspects covered by the news-sources that they follow. It should however be noted that there exists a skew in the aspect coverage in social media in many cases, i.e., not all aspects receive significant attention from social media in all cases.

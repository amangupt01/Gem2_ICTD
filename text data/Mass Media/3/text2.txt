This graph shows how the aspects are being spoken about in mass media, in terms of the overall aggregate sentiment of all statements made on that aspect. The sentiment slant for any statement can be positive, negative, or neutral. For an aspect, we add up all the sentiment values of the statements belonging to the aspect.
<br><br>
An example of a statement with positive sentiment about Farmers Protest:<br>
<b>"The State unit of Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has come out with a slew of attractive promises to the farming community in its special manifesto for farmers, which was released here on Sunday. Income security to farmers, setting aside 10 percent of the budget for agriculture, an income commission, daytime electricity and solar pump sets are some of the highlights of the manifesto.The party is promising an income security system that will guarantee an annual income of Rs. 1 lakh to each farming household...."</b><br><br>

An example of a statement with negative sentiment about Farmers Protest:<br><b>
"Taking a serious view of the alleged lapses in enumeration of crop loss by the official machinery, the CPI (M) district secretary Pothineni Sudarsan Rao has demanded that the government order a re-survey of the crop loss suffered by farmers in last years cyclone in the district.Speaking at the party's district executive committee meeting held in the town on Thursday, Mr. Sudarsan Rao deplored that cotton and paddy crops in thousands of acres were extensively damaged due to nature's fury in the district.Although, farmers suffered huge losses to the tune of Rs. 150 crore under the impact of a series of cyclones last year, the official machinery put the crop loss at a meagre Rs. 60 lakh, he deplored alleging that the entire enumeration process was carried out in a rhetoric manner....."</b><br>
We can see that the statements describe the main pattern here. The ruling party politicians make statements in support of the policy, while the opposition speaks negatively. The ruling party’s statement also addresses some of the structural issues in agriculture like electricity, irrigation, etc. as mentioned earlier. Thus, mass media does seem to focus on structural issues related to agriculture.<br><br>
 
The graph about social media shows the sentiment expressed in social media tweets.<br>
Positive tweets include statements like <span style="color:blue;"><i>  ‘ RT @Nesenag: TN has an outstanding debt of 3.14 L cr & waiving off cooperative loans will benefit 16L small farmers and will cost 5.8k cr,…’</i></span>

<br><br>
Negative tweets include statements like <span style="color:red;"><i>‘ Farmer commits suicide in the national capital in presence of 1000s of AAP/RSS volunteers.Didnt stop him Shame on #KisaanVirodhiNarendraModi ‘</i></span><br><br>
We can see that the tweets again describe the main pattern of echoing the mass media here. They generally are on farmer suicides and loan waivers, which are also some of the highest covered aspects in mass media. Both of these aspects are generally covered negatively in both mass media and social media as can also be seen from the graphs.

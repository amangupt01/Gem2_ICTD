For Aadhaar, the aspect <i> [Aadhaar enrollment centers]</i> has the maximum mean relative coverage, indicative of the mass mediaâ€™s push towards informing citizens about the enrollment centers (especially in cities). This aspect discusses the operational and procedural details of the policy implementation, like the problems at enrollment centers (long queues, issues with documents produced by the people, understaffed enrollment centers), and the different phases in which the enrollment was carried out. The aspect <i>[Court cases related to Aadhaar]</i>, which covers cases on privacy issues of Aadhaar data, and its applicability to public services, has the second largest coverage. These aspects are relevant to the consumer middle class, which is the dominant media audience anyway. However, we do not find a significant coverage provided to the issues directly relevant to the poor (for example, problems with public distribution system and other benefits due to malfunctioning Aadhaar linkage) .

Our analysis thus shows that in Aadhaar, the mass media primarily covers the middle class, but aspects that directly impact the poor are clearly neglected. This is obvious to an extent as the middle class constitutes the primary audience of mass media. Among some of the highest covered aspecyts <i>[Implementation of DBT]</i> is the only aspect that covers the problems related to implementation of direct benefit transfer scheme, which directly impact both the middle class and the poor. However, other pertinent issues like problems of malfunctioning Aadhaar linkage causing troubles to the poor especially in accessing ration from the public distribution system is neglected.

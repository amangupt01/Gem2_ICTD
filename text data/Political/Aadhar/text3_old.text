#Aspects are subtopics of discussion within a given policy. The above figure shows the coverage provided to various aspects by mass media for the policy Aadhaar. Here, the mean relative aspect coverage is shown for overall mass media, i.e., across all of the seven news-sources that we consider. For each policy, we calculate the mean relative aspect coverage as follows: we first find the relative aspect coverage corresponding to each news source as the number
#of words in all articles belonging to that aspect in that news source, divided by the number of words in all articles corresponding to that news source. Next, we find that the mean of this relative aspect coverage across all news sources, for that aspect.

#Our analysis shows that in most policies, the mass media follows a strictly technology-deterministic stance while reporting about the ICTD policies -- the reporting chiefly consists of positive comments on the policies, focusing on the technical advancements and international collaborations they bring. On the other hand, the problems in implementation of these policies, and the aspects that directly impact the poor, are clearly neglected. There does exist, however, some focus on the aspects related to the middle class, which is the primary audience of mass media.
Aspects are subtopics of discussion within a given policy. We use topic modelling methods to uncover the aspects discussed in the mass media about each of the policies being investigated. We compute the mean relative aspect coverage across all of the seven news-sources that we consider. This helps us see what kind of aspects the mass media prefers to highlight or ignore.

The above figure shows the coverage provided to the top 20 highest covered entities in mass media.<br><br>

Aadhaar sees the coverage of non-politicians like D.Y. Chandrachud, K.K. Venugopal, A.K. Sikri, and Rakesh Dwivedi, who are all judiciary members of the Supreme Court of India, which can be explained by the fact that a lot of debates took place in the judiciary around the Aadhaar policy, although it revolved around the constitutional legitimacy of the policy. We also find the presence of Ajay Bhushan Pandey, a bureaucrat in Aadhaar and currently the CEO of UIDAI, and Nandan Nilekani, a business-person and the proponent of Aadhaar. The only social development expert getting mentioned among the top 20 entities in mass media is Jean Dreze, who has been vocal against the policy on the failure of Aadhaar implementation leading to denial of ration to the poor<br><br>

Overall, we can see that most of the top 20 highest covered entities are politicians. This is followed by business people, bureaucrats (IAS officers), and judiciary members. Academicians and social development experts from the civil society (including social activists and researchers documenting successes and failures of these policies) are provided negligible coverage by mass media. Thus, the coverage provided to policies in mass media mostly belongs to the politicians, and the blame games that they indulge in. In case of Aadhaar, this is followed by judiciary members as there were several court cases around data privacy, which connected to the middle class readership of the mass media. Finally, we also see a corporate alignment in the policy coverage. However, several academicians and social activists who raised their voice against the faulty implementation of the policy, and the problems caused to the poor thereby do not receive sufficient coverage in mainstream media.

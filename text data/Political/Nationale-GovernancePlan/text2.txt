Both the ruling party and the opposition members are seen to speak mostly positively on E-Governance. Similar to Digital India, the opposition here is again not completely negative about the policy as it was ideated when they (INC) were in power.

An example of a statement with positive sentiment:<b> “ We will transform governance, making it more transparent, accountable, accessible and participative, Modi said, adding that e-governance is the foundation of better governance efficient, economical and effective.”</b><br><br>
An example of a statement with negative sentiment:<b> “ Despite a few shortcomings, the draft telecom policy 2011 is practical and forward looking, write Ajith Athrady and Dilip Maitra. Amid the telecom sector passing through rough patches due to the 2g spectrum scam, the union telecom minister Kapil Sibal recently announced the draft of a new telecom policy (NTP) aiming to provide a fillip to the country’s fastest growing industry.”</b><br><br>

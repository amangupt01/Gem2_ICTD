For E-governance, we find the aspect <i>[E-governance in transport department] </i>to be one of the most widely covered aspects, which covers online applications and technologies built for convenient fee payment by the stakeholders, again an aspect relevant for the middle class. This is followed by <i>[International cooperation and collaboration w.r.t. E-governance]</i>. Once again, this aspect is more about collaboration of MNCs and other international organizations wrt the technological front of the various facets of E-governance. In this policy too, we find a conspicuous lack of coverage provided to the issues directly connected to the poor.

Similar to Digital India, most of the top aspects covered in mass media for E-governance lie on the side of technical advancement and international collaborations that the policy has brought. The focus mostly lies on the middle class and on the corporate constituency. However, there seems to be negligible focus on the issues of the poor, and the problems with policy implementation (like issues of trust, infrastructural issues, and the digital divide).

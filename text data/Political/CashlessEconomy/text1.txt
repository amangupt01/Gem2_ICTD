The above figure shows the coverage provided to the top 20 highest covered entities in mass media. The policy push towards Cashless Payments shows the presence of business-persons like Mukesh Ambani and Vijay Shekhar Sharma, judiciary members like Bhim Sen Sehgal, and economic advisors like Urjit Patel and Nandan Nilekani because it is an economic policy issue. It is noteworthy that Vijay Shekhar Sharma is the founder of PayTM, which gained immediate leverage in the wake of Cashless Economy.<br><br> Overall, we can see that the same trend follows for Cashless Economy: most of the top covered entities are politicians, followed by businesspersons, and there is a clear lack of representation of  academicians, policy experts, and civil society members.
 Thus, even for Cashless economy, we see that the mass media provides maximum coverage to the politicians. We also find that the media coverage is corporate aligned, with prominent business-persons and their statements being covered frequently. In some cases, this trend is representative of the corporate interests that the involvement of big corporations is supposed to fulfil. On the other hand, feedback from policy experts and social activists that actually might focus on the technical nuances of the policy do not see a significant coverage.

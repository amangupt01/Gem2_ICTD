For Cashless Economy, the aspect <i>[Ruling and opposition partiesâ€™ debates on Demonetization]</i> gets the highest mean relative coverage in mass media. This is followed by aspects like <i>[Cashless banking, mobile banking, and Internet banking]</i>;<i> [Developments on UPI, mobile wallets, and payment gateways]</i>; and <i>[Discussion on hardships due to Demonetization]</i>. These aspects mostly represent discussions on the advanced technologies and applications implemented for the policy, and the troubles that common people emphasize, but nearly ignores issues faced by the poor. In fact, apart from <i>[Discussion on hardships due to Demonetization]</i>, there is no coverage provided to any aspect, which is directly connected to the problems of the poor (for example, problems faced by the poor in using digital wallets, low level of digital literacy among the poor, problems with network infrastructure in rural areas, etc.). Thus, similar to the other three policy issues, in Cashless Economy too, there is deficiency in detailed discussion on issues of the poor. It must also be noted that even if such a discussion does happen, it happends by way of politicization of the issue as seen for Demonetization.

For Digital India, we find <i>[Development of cities as Smart Cities]</i> to have the highest coverage,
followed by <i>[FDI and investments of multinational companies in India]</i>. The former aspect talks about the futuristic technologies, applications, technology led change, and role of technical advancement in development (Smart Cities). The latter aspect speaks more on investments done by MNCs in India, leading to a positive effect on the Indian economy as a benefit from the policy. On the other hand, aspects like <i>[Digitization of land records]</i>, which provide people knowledge about the actual technical nuances of the policy issue and the challenges faced in the policy implementation, are neglected.

If we look at the top five aspects covered by the mass media for Digital India, we see the same trend -- the focus of the mass media is mostly on the techical advancement that the policy is supposed to bring. However, we do not find aspects related to detailed discussion of the technical nuances of the policy, or on the faults in policy implementation (like problems in accessing technical alternatives in rural areas, digital illiteracy, and so on). This shows that the media is not really keen on focusing on the grass root issues pertaining to the policy implementation or to the problems of people.

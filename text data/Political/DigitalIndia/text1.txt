The above figure shows the coverage provided to the top 20 highest covered entities in mass media. Digital India policy contains Mukesh Ambani and Nandan Nilekani among the top covered entities. This is because Ambani brought out the Jio network, which has disrupted the telecom space by providing very low-cost 4G connectivity.<br><br> Overall, we can see that most of the top 20 highest covered entities for Digital India are politicians, with businesspersons following next. However, there is negligible coverage provided to academicians, policy experts, and civil society members. As can be seen in case of Mukesh Ambani, the involvement of prominent business-persons in the discourse on policies is a trend directly indicative of the corporate interests that are being fulfilled through the policy implementation. However, valuable feedback from social activists (who might aid in collecting citizens' feedback at a ground level) and policy experts is often neglected in mass media.
